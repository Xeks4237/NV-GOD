NV-GOD is a Best NeoVim Distro

NV-GOD is creted by Me, because other distros of NeoVim like LazyVim or AstroNVim uses their own repos like a some pack with different pre-configured options, plugins, autocmds and etc. It's a easy and good choise for devs and new users but for advanced users like me who wants to use their work like a base for their own configs, it's a big headache to work with, because I prefer to change default configs than rewrite it after start of it.
You can say "but what about kickstart.nvim?" I know about it, it's a beautifull project but it more about to help new users to make their own NeoVim setup and understand how it works(it taked me 2 min to read everything what them made>:v)


## Future Requirements which gonna be needed - (which I defenetly know)
- Latest version of NVim
- Latest version of Git (For Stuff releted to plugins and to install NV-GOD)
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) **_(optional but recommended, just choose one which you like, for example JetBrainsMono NF)_**
- a **C** compiler(gcc for example) for compiling different stuff releted to the most popular plugins like treesitter

## Installation

- Before Startting to install PLEASE backup your old config of NVim if exists
- This command Just gonna rename directory with your old config from "nvim" to "nvim-backup":

  ```sh
  mv ~/.config/nvim/ ~/.config/nvim-backup/
  mv ~/.local/share/nvim/ ~/.local/share/nvim-backup/
  ```

For Installation of NV-GOD, You need to choose a correct NV-GOD-Starter for your needs, with type of a default setup, minimalistic with only essentials, full featured IDE instalation, or a setup to start from scratch with only configs

- IDE setup (work in progress)
- Minimal setup (work in progress)
- Scratch Setup (work in progress)

Just create a your own repo on github using NV-GOD-Starter which you choosed as a Template on github, after making it, go over a instalation instructions of your template what you choosed

Mostly you just need to clone it with git
It gonna allow you to save your own configuration on github for better managment of NV-GOD using git :)

## Future Features which I plan to make:

- First make it more like a Distro or IDE, because for now it's a one really simple config

- GOD Package Manager UI (or just GPM-UI) which gonna be able to Easyly install any package manager on first startup and gonna have ability to easyly search and install plugins, colorschemes, packs of them(like ability to install all plugins of other distros) and Custom configs of others who to uses NV-GOD, in simple and slick ui screen(which is gonna be Really customizable), like MarketPlace of VSCode, But on Steroids

- Made it as much MODULAR as possible

- Made it More Easy configure for new users and pro NVim enjoyers than LazyVim, NV-Chad, and AstroNVim Distros

There's a great video created by Me with the explanation of everything about NV-GOD, "future link"
(gonna make a video laterðŸ˜…, after making at least NV-GOD 1.0)

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

This is a Main File Structure of NV-GOD, which I plan to make, If you want to add something or change default settings on your NV-GOD installation(Information about it gonna be on future WIKI page of NV-GOD)

Package Manager on this example is a [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
But it gonna be a little bit different on other cases with other package managers(But similar)
