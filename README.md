NV-GOD is a Best NeoVim Distro

NV-GOD is creted by Me, because other distros of NeoVim like LazyVim or AstroNVim uses their own repos like a some pack with different pre-configured options, plugins, autocmds and etc. It's a easy and good choise for devs and new users but for advanced users like me who wants to use their work like a base for their own configs, it's a big headache to work with.

- You can say "but what about kickstart.nvim? why you just don't use it" I know about it, it's a beautifull project but it more about to help new users to make their own NeoVim setup and understand how it works(it taked me 2 min to read everything on their entire repo >:v)

## Why you need to choose NV-GOD
- It's just betterðŸ—¿, seriously just choose it(when it gets v1.0 version only)

## Future Requirements which gonna be needed - (which I defenetly know)
- Latest version of **NVim**
- Latest version of **Git**
- **C** compiler (gcc for example)
- **npm** for some plugins
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) **_(optional but recommended, just choose one which you like, for example JetBrainsMono NF)_**

## Installation

- Before Starting Installation, PLEASE backup your old config of NVim if it exists
- This command Just gonna rename directory with your old config from "nvim" to "nvim-backup":

  ```sh
  mv ~/.config/nvim/ ~/.config/nvim-backup/
  mv ~/.local/share/nvim/ ~/.local/share/nvim-backup/
  ```

For Installation of NV-GOD, You need to choose a correct NV-GOD-Starter for your needs, with type of a default setup, minimalistic with only essentials, full featured IDE installation, or a setup to start from scratch with only configs

- IDE setup (work in progress)
- Minimal setup (work in progress)
- Scratch Setup (work in progress)

Just create a your own repo on github using NV-GOD-Starter which you choosed as a Template on github, after making it, go over a installation instructions of your template what you choosed()

Mostly you just need to clone it from github with git
It gonna allow you to save your own NV-GOD configuration on github, For better managment of your NV-GOD configuratio using git :)

## Future Features which I plan to make:

- First make it more like a Distro or IDE, because for now it's a one really simple config

- GOD Package Manager UI (or just GPM-UI) which gonna be able to Easyly install any package manager on first startup and gonna have ability to easyly search and install plugins, colorschemes, packs of them(like ability to install all plugins of other distros) and Custom configs of others who to uses NV-GOD, in simple and slick ui screen(which is gonna be Really customizable), like MarketPlace of VSCode, But on Steroids

- Made it as much MODULAR as possible

- Made it More Easy configure for new users and pro NVim enjoyers than LazyVim, NV-Chad, and AstroNVim Distros

There's a great video created by Me with the explanation of everything about NV-GOD
(gonna make a video laterðŸ˜…, after making at least NV-GOD v1.0)

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

This is a Main File Structure of NV-GOD, which I plan to make, If you want to add something or change default settings on your NV-GOD installation(Information about it gonna be on future WIKI page of NV-GOD)

Package Manager on this example is a [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
But it gonna be a little bit different on other cases with other package managers(But similar)
